1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:05,120
In home now

2
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:07,936
I'm not going

3
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:26,368
Everyone has

4
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,744
Lol opening

5
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:34,304
I have no idea

6
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:41,472
Goggles goggles

7
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:46,080
Safety first

8
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:50,176
You do not need this

9
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:59,136
No

10
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,720
Well I think so well

11
00:01:54,944 --> 00:02:01,088
Core

12
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:05,440
Kinda like a Cyprus in the kid that said in the back of the class is actually pretty fun

13
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:11,840
Probably did a little too

14
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:15,168
It was not as crumble

15
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:21,056
Contact when they are there

16
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:24,640
I hit him too hard that one night

17
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:32,064
If you like these are one

18
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,648
Beautiful honest

19
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,440
This one at 4

20
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,232
This is a

21
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:47,168
Pictures of bad boy in there you have to put it in the summer and put it in a long

22
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,728
Wine

23
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:52,288
Oh yeah

24
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:56,384
We're going to hold it so that it doesn't

25
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,664
Go into your eyes

26
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,712
Not done Force too hard

27
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:01,504
Otherwise you'll break the entire

28
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,600
Not in the middle of it will seem right down the middle hair

29
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,136
I would think

30
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:13,536
You get the screwdriver in the same and give it a whack

31
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,912
Do you want me to do with the way my mother used to do it

32
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:28,896
Inside this

33
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:34,272
To try putting it up so your history on Steam

34
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,240
111

35
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,920
A crack a walnut here

36
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:08,320
This is not a difficult task but you do need to make sure that you get the right in to start with

37
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:16,000
No problem it will open that way but that's a little bit messy around your kitchen

38
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:22,399
So my favourite method inside and outside they're all this

39
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:26,495
This is where you don't want to be

40
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:28,287
Put the sky over

41
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:31,615
So that you can see your flat inside on the bottom of a walnut

42
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:38,015
And there usually is a little bit of a crack right in there and this is your point of entry into your wallet if

43
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,599
When somebody is banging with a hammer

44
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:47,999
You can use anything

45
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,023
Cut your hair

46
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,607
Going gently

47
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:55,935
Twist

48
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,055
It should be cleanly and

49
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:07,967
I've never done this before but just on the edge of a spatula

50
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,015
Safe to use

51
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:14,879
They should be all that we need

52
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,951
I'm going to find that openings

53
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:21,535
Going to stick the corner of the spatula in there

54
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:31,263
If you don't

55
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:35,103
Who was the actual top of the Nutcracker

56
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:37,919
And this guy is actually designed to do this

57
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:41,759
Simple enough to just putting a knife in between the Nutcracker

58
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,039
And tracking it

59
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:47,391
It comes apart amazing how well
