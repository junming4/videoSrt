1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:03,328
Ok so high

2
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:04,608
Ok

3
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:17,664
Snake

4
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:24,832
I'm gonna try I think I can figure it out

5
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:39,168
Call Kay

6
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:47,104
Maybe this won't work with it

7
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:54,016
What's the weather

8
00:00:54,272 --> 00:01:00,416
This is cute

9
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:12,448
Oh my god

10
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:18,848
This is terrifying

11
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:21,920
Turn off

12
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:29,088
Anymore for the sake of my hand like a hexagon

13
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:35,488
Structural integrity of the pineapple is a falling apart

14
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,608
Ok we're going to cut this pineapple

15
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:42,656
First

16
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:44,192
Off

17
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:46,240
The top

18
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:50,080
Turn off the bar

19
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:55,712
Cut down the sides to take the skin off

20
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,992
Probably nobody

21
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:04,928
Go down the middle and get rid of a corn

22
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,464
Take this down in the cinema

23
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,120
And now I'm coming into the

24
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:23,360
Covering up ok

25
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:34,624
To do when you're getting a pineapple top in the bottom of the pineapple

26
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,440
So that things are Rolling away from us when we try and catch

27
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:42,304
Pineapple we want to stand up and work your way down the sides

28
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,656
Is to get rid of the eyes which are the dad's right here

29
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:50,240
Without losing too much flesh ok so you want to get in

30
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:53,056
About a half an inch in word

31
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,080
Working away

32
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,152
That was pretty good

33
00:02:57,408 --> 00:03:02,784
I'm happy with that I'm outside and I'm going to start putting this into

34
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,552
Desks

35
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:10,720
On this afternoon to do is take the Rings by hand

36
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:11,744
Rotating

37
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,536
My way around the corner

38
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,864
The goal here is just to get that

39
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,400
Core of the sun

40
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,984
If you're using a pineapple coring tool

41
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,264
Which is

42
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,544
This guy right here

43
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,872
You can really just go straight into the top twist the tour

44
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:35,040
Take the core out this way this is a fine method but I find that you'll get a substantial amount of waste this way

45
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:36,832
The core

46
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:40,928
What's the weather in the centre of the pineapple regardless of the size of your penis

47
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:44,256
You end up losing the sort of outside edge of the pipe

48
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:49,888
It certainly works and we're going to get Rings out of it

49
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,448
I did it

50
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,776
The ring

51
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:58,592
Right right

52
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:02,176
Wow

53
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:08,320
A delicious piece of pineapple
