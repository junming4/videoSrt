29
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:24,640

00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,696
First I'm going to put it down

34
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:44,096
People want to use a rolling pin

00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:48,960
Crispbread or flatbread pizza so I have my flat

36
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,240

37
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,032
I'm going to start to press down my

38
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,824
Continually turning it

00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,992
The doll with my hair

41
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:04,064
Instead of tossing it for the most part I'm going to take it

42
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,600
And start to

43
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:09,184

I'm going to sleep

47
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:20,192
When you stretch a day like this one is your knuckles not your things you think so

48
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:24,544
Play some you're just passing it to move around on your knob

49
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:30,432
So now I got to have a nice cross it's fairly saying I can start to cook

50
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,992
You can just turn on your pain now

51
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:43,744
Shut up
