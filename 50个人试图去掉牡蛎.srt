15

2
00:00:01,536 --> 00:00:05,376
Million viewers are going to Hinder this and say

3
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:20,736
Second-hand diving shark news

4
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:35,328
It's been a long time

5
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:39,680
I want to go home with all my

6
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:48,384
This looks like a job for me

7
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:02,464
Give me some

8
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:10,400
Particularly

9
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:26,528
I think so

10
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,256
Oyster is now

11
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:38,560
Akash open

12
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:41,120
And then if I had crazy glue

13
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:45,728
I could put it this shell back together

14
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,288
Is no problem

15
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,384
I think is good

16
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:58,528
Favourite things in the entire world

17
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:03,648
Nothing really sorry just want to do

18
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,768
Women

19
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:12,864
Just on my way around and tell her

20
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:19,520
Massage to get juicy there I need his leg

21
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:25,664
In one Swift move

22
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,736
Circle wall around it

23
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,528
From the shelf

24
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,264
Oyster here you can always identify an oyster is having a blue top and a bottom

25
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:57,664
Changeable upside is going to be the bottom shelf in the flat inside is going to be the Top Shop

26
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:04,064
To come in at the points and we're going to find the hinge is probably a good idea to wear a bra

27
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:10,464
Non dominant hand

28
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,328
The Quays opening Easter is about twisting not pushed into the head

29
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:18,400
Go back and forth until you feel the open up there

30
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:21,216
Manhole disguise

31
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,264
I'm going to try the note

32
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,592
The inside of the top shelf slide in between

33
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,736
And slide ride across that does this separate the muscle of the Oyster

34
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,528
From the shell on a

35
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:36,064
Ok so that my

36
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,088
Easter is

37
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:43,488
Nicely preserved on the inside
