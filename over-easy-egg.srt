1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,560
I have never even heard of an over easy egg

2
00:00:02,816 --> 00:00:06,400
Really creative

3
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:13,312
Over easy egg I don't know what that means

4
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:17,920
Let's see what happens

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:25,344
I'm going to butter this

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:30,464
Everything

7
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:39,424
What's happened

8
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:44,032
Extra calcium

9
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:56,576
I feel like over easy eggs is supposed to be burnt and disgusting

10
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:58,624
Dimplex

11
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,904
What they have done

12
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:02,976
Scoop of that

13
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:09,376
Oh you know what I was thinking of his Sunny Side Up does that mean oh no

14
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:15,264
Rxl

15
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:21,664
123

16
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,528
Oh my god

17
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:30,368
Entirely sure

18
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,160
What constitutes an over easy egg

19
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:34,720
How do I ever actually go to a restaurant

20
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,024
Fancy eggs

21
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:43,680
Ok I won't make another easier over easy means that we

22
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,704
Gently

23
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,984
Turn it over

24
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,520
The other side

25
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:51,360
First step is a little little tiny baby oil

26
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,968
I'm going to break your hand

27
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,552
Will Alsop

28
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,576
Pepper on top

29
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:10,304
Wait for it to set around the metal checking around the edges to see that it's gonna Lift up nicely

30
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,936
And then I'm going to put it over

31
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:18,752
Just go for it Flip It Over

32
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,104
Flip in the air

33
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:26,688
Learning about 10 seconds still be done

34
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,808
Over easy egg

35
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,368
First drive

36
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:44,608
Another easy egg is an egg that the white is set on both sides

37
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,632
TripAdvisor

38
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,168
And the yoke is still

39
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,704
So I get my pen

40
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:51,520
Warm not super hot I'm getting a little bit of

41
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:58,176
Oil is best for over easy eggs because they keep the Browning down if you use butter the butter sauce the brown before the egg is cooked in

42
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,968
Can you get brown crispy

43
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,296
Get to where the oil is just trying to catch a shimmer

44
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:06,112
And run around the pan and then break your right into the pain

45
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,440
I really don't want much movement when I go to the pier

46
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:13,280
You can see that it's starting to just like Lisa

47
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,840
At this point we need to add all of this on

48
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:18,144
I always season 8 have my eggs

49
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,680
20 assault

50
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,472
Nothing worse than a brand

51
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,264
I know you can see this trying to say

52
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,800
There's two

53
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:29,152
Parts to the white the white on the outside surface that is an inside part of the white

54
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:32,480
Can I watch a start ASAP before I flip it if I flip over for them

55
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,272
The engine the car falls apart

56
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:37,088
That's when you start to break BO2 things start to get messy

57
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,880
So you can see them outside

58
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,160
History of the

59
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,952
Get undressed really aggressive

60
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:48,096
What's the way to set on the other side and I don't want to cook in anymore

61
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:50,144
Ok so I'm going to take it off the heat

62
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,192
Am I going to play

63
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:59,104
You want to get a special cos he just said that to the you give me an oil that actually in the pen on

64
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,408
Play that's what you know what you want a greasy

65
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,176
Ovaries

66
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:09,344
I really rate test to see if your egg is right is the

67
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,928
You can see that my joke is running

68
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,976
Demo white is fully

69
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,512
Get me some toast this is for you

70
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,303
Anatomy

71
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:27,007
Haha
