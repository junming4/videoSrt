00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,608
Now

2
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:12,032
How do I get a new clothes

3
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:16,128
A poached egg

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,016
A poached egg

5
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,808
The dirty eggs

6
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:29,952
Sunny Side Up over easy

7
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:33,792
It looks something like this

8
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,168
I have no clue

9
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:43,776
You guys are not fair this is pressure

10
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,712
Nice and easy

11
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:57,600
Very close to a poached egg

12
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:58,880
Is it

13
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:05,024
I think this

14
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,304
Was a little bit crap

15
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,840
Wickes

16
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:14,240
I think they're the egg is becoming gradually more delicious as tango

17
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,360
A cooks itself

18
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:21,408
In the water

19
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,944
Not directly in the water

20
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,784
Amelia Monet

21
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:29,600
Work

22
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,000
Tarot reading work

23
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:43,680
A bit like egg drop soup

24
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:47,520
Yeah I'm just gonna hold this year

25
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:50,592
Keep it swelling together somehow

26
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:55,456
Maybe I need to

27
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:06,464
All the whites place

28
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,888
Ok

29
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:14,912
Well

00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,008
Konosuba

32
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:27,200
In boiling water

33
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:31,296
Boiling water

34
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:39,232
Small amounts of vinegar

35
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,376
American football

36
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:50,752
You spin the water bit making a world

37
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:53,056
Because this way consolidates the egg white

38
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,848
It's going in a different Direction

39
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,920
Set alarm from a guy name

40
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,456
Emeril lagasse

41
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,904
Ok we're texting and then you clap it in the service of the water and drop it

42
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,184
Centre of the Earth

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,792
Winter dinner doesn't leave it

44
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:21,984
I like my poached eggs over a bit runny so as soon as they are

45
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,384
Little loose

46
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,920
Hard boiled egg

47
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,064
The slab on somebody's playlist is rude

48
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,208
He's dumped me

49
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,632
Ok so we are going to poach an egg

50
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:56,032
I meant to look inside the pot here and where to find water

51
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:59,104
For putting an egg

52
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,128
All the way

53
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,920
Any just turn it back on

54
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:04,480
So when a Jew is reduced by heat

55
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:10,880
Just a little bit down to a simmer look like

56
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:17,280
Especially running up the side of the pen without any word bubbles breaking the surface of the water

57
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:23,679
Keep the temperature relative to spread out in the world

58
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:35,711
Some other acid that would be fine because what's happening here is the acid is going to calculate what I mean

59
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,503
Is going to go like that

60
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:43,903
If we got the acid in the water what's going to happen again it's going to spread out everywhere

61
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,719
Water in the park

62
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:53,119
So I'm just going to hear from you to drop eggs into the water works really well here is actually to create

63
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:59,519
Like a whirlpool in the park sucked into the centre of that world

64
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:00,543
Reduce the voting age

65
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:06,943
Is the keyboard close eye on the temperature and constantly adjust as it cooks and

66
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,967
Put into the water

67
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:14,367
Some people into a small ball in the war

68
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:21,023
That's up to you but I would avoid it's cracking the egg on the side of a pot

69
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,607
Go for a flat surface

70
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:28,959
Just a quick break and we just going to drop that right into the

71
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,519
Shouldn't stick to anything and it shouldn't

72
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:36,639
Spread out in the party you can see it's already starting to coagulate or colour

73
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,431
Bunch up on itself

74
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:44,575
Gerald umbrella radio on supermarket large egg cooking in about 3 minutes

75
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:48,671
So when you find this fish batter was really effectively at removing it

76
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:55,071
Is the water very well and it's got a nice soup for picking up the egg out of the park when we got into the yolk itself

77
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,679
The perfect degree of doneness mean

78
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:03,007
Egg white in a nice runny egg
