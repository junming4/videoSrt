1
00:00:01,792 --> 00:00:02,816
I'm an Aries

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,912
I think I actually did well and tell this

3
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:07,680
Exactly

4
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:17,408
I have not I don't think I even a soft-boiled egg

5
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:22,016
You probably want to put eggs in the boiling water

6
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:33,792
Drop the egg in there

7
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:40,192
I have no idea how long this could cause the water which I hear

8
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:41,728
Boiling

9
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:48,128
A lot of smoke smoke follows beauty

10
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:54,528
What's the weather on exploded already

11
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:02,720
I've seen less in movies

12
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:11,936
Can you drop in on the floor do I need to make it

13
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:18,336
Oh my god look at that that's not good alright

14
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:23,712
I don't know who it is

15
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:26,528
I really don't know what I'm doing

16
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:27,296
Ok

17
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:28,832
What is one right now

18
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,368
I'm going to add in

19
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,904
Inwido

20
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:36,256
The hardest thing about make a soft-boiled egg

21
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,864
Messi 6 minutes

22
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:45,216
It's almost done

23
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:51,360
I'll give it another minute yourself the perfect soft-boiled egg has a completely running

24
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,640
Set y

25
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:56,736
You eat it by opening the top and getting into the egg

26
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,784
Egg is ready

27
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,624
Flavour in the ice water

28
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,648
Start the cooking

29
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:10,560
We are going to play set in the Tracy I hold

30
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,376
Give it a little

31
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,216
Hazelton test what we have in the mirror

32
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:18,752
He looks like

33
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,288
Nice running

34
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:24,128
How is a success

35
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,920
How much babbling poets

36
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,976
When I'm making a soft-boiled egg out with the boiling water

37
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,024
What is a rapid boil

38
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:47,680
I'm going to lower my eggs and gently just throw them in the park fully covered with water otherwise the top of the legs

39
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:51,264
Outside the water in doesn't come in there for 5 or 6 min

40
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:54,336
How much are looking for is a nice creamy white

41
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,872
Anna soft running you

42
00:02:56,384 --> 00:03:02,528
Will you stop all the eggs in boiling don't do anything

43
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,832
What is moving your fine leave it alone

44
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:07,904
I got a slide spoon I take it out of the water ok

45
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:14,048
If you need anything other than healing rideaway like ramen for example I take them out of the water now

46
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:20,448
And I use them down because to be firm in the UK to be creamy when I slice into and

47
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,216
What's my boiler room

48
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,520
What's the most powerful enemies

49
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:26,336
Right out of the park for breakfast or lunch

50
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,640
Do you get an egg cup these things are in Durham

51
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,688
Do you have an egg cup get a shot glass

52
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,736
Most people have psychosis after house

53
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:35,808
You take it out and rested in your egg cup

54
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:40,416
The real way to test if you've made a proper soft boiled egg if you have to open it up and look after

55
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:44,000
So crack around the edge fairly straight line if I can

56
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,280
Can I open up

57
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:48,608
What's the best way to do this is to break into with the school

58
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,912
So you your Whites are

59
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:55,264
And firm and your yoke is super super

60
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,312
Anatomy of soft boiled egg

61
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,952
Shot on me guys
