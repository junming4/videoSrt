00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:07,711
Chicken tenders I just want to show you two approaches were reading with that flower we got an egg wash bread

75
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:14,111
The flower is like the glue and in the end it's going to stick

76
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:18,719
Breadcrumbs on to the surface on the outside

77
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:25,119
Three 15 in a joke is we're going to season chicken directly

78
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:28,447
Next step is really key and a lot of people forget to do this

79
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,263
Seasoned the stages of the

80
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:37,919
Ok chicken tender when I drop it into the flour and then shake off the excess

81
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:43,807
Play drop it into the egg mixture to probably want to wear some gloves or at least make sure that you are

82
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:46,879
Being sanitary about making sure that you're not cross contaminated

83
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:51,743
Add this right into the flour and one good tricks to keep one hand dryer in one hand

84
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:58,143
So I'm going to be able to read and when I drop it into dry again when I get this out of I'm using my dry hair

85
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:04,031

86
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:09,663
Tipping into a little bit of butter milk pictures of tiny little bit at the bottom of the flower

87

Cooking times 3 5-minutes should be fine you're always listening for that that is not going in

93
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:39,103
Chicken into a pan of oil that's too cold

94
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:42,431
What's going to happen if the chicken is going to absorb the oil like a

95
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:47,807
Looking for is 165 degrees C in Fahrenheit temperature that's the same temperature

96
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:52,927
