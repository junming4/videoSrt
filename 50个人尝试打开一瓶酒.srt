00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:25,344
Ok

3
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:34,560
You have a stranger of the minute I heard this is a rocking you can grow up

4
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:39,936
Get access to the cork

5
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:44,544
Service 2 minutes

6
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:57,600
I have exposed then you have to get

7
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,440
No

8
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:03,488
What are the Euro

9
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,840
I think maybe

10
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,192
Looks legit

11
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,984
I believe this is one of them

12
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:18,592
Can you do this one again

13
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:24,992
Negotiate

14
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:31,392
Hello this is for you this is a fancy corkscrew not going in

15
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:39,328
I'm screwing the screw in the top is already now like

16
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:49,568
There is a particular way I know

17
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,320
Coming out

18
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,544
And then we bought it you know

19
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,640
I got

20
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:27,456
First thing I want to do is that you want to peel away

21
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,808
Always cut below this

22
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,280
We want to place the top

23
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,864
Single yellow bottle

24
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:51,008
Little Lever

25
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,288
Cancel

26
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:57,408
This is my favourite auto opening wine

27
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:03,040
You twisted down I think it is easier to apply pressure on the corkscrew

28
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,368
Is Ireland supposed to come out

29
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,648
Down

30
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,744
I was told

31
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,792
That if you can hear the bells

32
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:17,376
Correctly in the fire

33
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,168
Put the barber to my list

34
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,192
Security and

35
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:33,248
Open a bottle of wine

36
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:39,648
Contact with the Wind that's going to change the flavour profile I make sure I'm nice and

37
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:42,208
So there's no chance to the foil

38
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,256
Is going to come into contact with

39
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:50,656
Listen to do is drive the screw into the you can do it an angle so we can find the setup and just

40
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:03,456
Is designed to sit on the lip of the wine bottle support that the dark side of this lever

41
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,992
Is it against your hand

42
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,784
Gently Paul

43
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,856
Rene simply for here

44
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,464
Don't worry about the break in the glass

45
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,000
The point

46
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,280
Turn back in
