1
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:03,584
It's that time of season

2
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:10,496
Alright

3
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:12,544
I hate this

4
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:19,456
What is it I will call to Bell pepper my girlfriend gifts from Australia

5
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:25,856
Capsicums

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,440
That's fine

7
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:34,816
Go for it

8
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:37,632
I have never

9
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:38,400

Can I sing

12
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:05,536
The smell in hoover

13
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:11,168
So what do I do after a D&C

14
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:21,152
I don't want to be

15
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:28,576
Someone taught me how to do this

16
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,112
You and I

17
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,928
Remember

18
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:35,744
So what you do this take this out

19
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,352
Like a pumpkin cut in half

20
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:44,192
Alexa and Karen ages

21
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,032

22
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:48,800
Call

23
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,456
What all do is I cut out the kiss

24
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:01,856
Dangerous jet Lee

25
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,024
I know there's like a fancy way to do it

26
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,048
This app

27
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,840
Play most recent

28
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:16,192
How many kg are left hand

29
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:20,032
Turn off light

30
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:23,616
Slices app

31
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:26,432
We are sliced

32
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,968
The work of art

33
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:38,976
So just like any other vegetable find yourself or flat sides for your vegetables not rolling around when you cry

34
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,512
Miniature in the bottom your

35
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:46,400
Basically you have natural seem so you can see this sort of has a square shape and I'm gonna follow those natural scenes

36
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,960
As my divided

37
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:50,496
Work my way down the pepper

38
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,544
King of the court

39
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,920
Inside the pepper you'll have some white this is the path we want to remove it going to come in with my parents

40
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:58,944
And

41
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,736
Turn that radio

42
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,784
Just like that making a horizontal

43
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,064
Once I have that removed

44
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,600
Then I'm single

45
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:10,976
Come through you'll find it much easier to slice of pepper with the skin side down

46
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,512
If I put the skin up

47
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:17,376
The night has a tendency to countdown soften the skin because of the flash underneath is much softer than that

48
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,424
Skin side down

49
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:33,248
