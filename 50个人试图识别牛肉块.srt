00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:45,056
I got this

8
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:47,616
Like a piece of lemon

9
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:55,552

00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:20,640
Ok comes from the centre section of the room can I come in around the bottom side of the cow this is a really great day

16
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,968
Low and slow

17
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:27,296
Moisty not good for throwing on the grill

18
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:42,912
No

19
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,264

00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:02,880
Martin Thornton

23
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,696
It looks like a swim cap

24
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:06,976
Remind me

25
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:10,048
Who wants to be seen but not

26
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:17,216
Papery

27
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,056
Outlook

28
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:24,384
If my life depended on it I couldn't really tell you

29
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,176
Placenta

30
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,456
What's it called

31
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:29,760
Stomach

32
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:33,856
Remember the name

33
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:38,720
No thank you

34
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,536
Tripe is the lining of one of the

35
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:47,936
Well it looks very tasty

36
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:52,800
It doesn't taste like

37
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,896
This is true

38
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:01,760
This is from the digestive system of the cow is really really

39
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:06,880
Has certainly flavoured on its own and this really benefits from long low and slow cooker

40
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,160
To bring out the flavour

41
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,096
When you look

42
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,400
This is this is what you looking for

43
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,448

5

46
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:34,272
It's the defining part of a bowl

47
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,040
Which is

48
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:37,600
This is fascinating

49
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,648
I would expect to see like

50
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,184
Tune in here somewhere

51
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,536
Muscular

52
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:49,888
I'm not sure what this is but I probably playlist

53
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:52,960
Looks like steak and I think state comes from the

54
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:56,032

00:03:56,544 --> 00:04:02,688
The hair stick

56
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:05,504
Which is part of the animals whole like breathing

57
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,808
Muscle centre like skirt steak

58
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:12,672
The Hanger steak that's a right here this one has a really

59
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:19,071
Easy way to identify and that's the there's a member in that runs down the centre and everything a stick

60
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:22,911
The green that runs in a v pattern so you can see the grain here these lines

61
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:27,263
Going here and coming from the other side that's how you can recognise the Hangouts

62
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:30,079

63
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:36,479

00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,159
It is so hard

74
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,951
Beefheart

Do you want to come out and you can see the Chambers

80
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,359
The heart

81
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:43,551
This is a portion of a beef for this gives you an idea of how big a beef heart actually is and we only have

82
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:47,135
Corner of it right here so you can pick you up I'll bring the whole thing with you

00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,567
The Rings

86
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:15,039

87
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:15,807
Tongue

88
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:19,647

00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,615
How do you cook

94
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:43,967
It looks like a steak on the underside

95
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,855
It has all the Little Lights

96
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,951

When your tasting the Carol you just have to think about the cows he seemed you

99
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:07,519
This is a Celtic this needs to be cooked in slow but when it is really really really

100
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,287
Delicious

101
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:14,687
Cows eat grass all day don't get a lot of use and when muscle mass get a lot of use

102
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:18,015
To be a laptop

103
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,575
The other thing to know about the time we need

104
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,367
Peel the skin off of the sky

105
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:24,671
And it is your appeal after it's cooked

00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,231
These are some of the beef cuts

107
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:31,071
2

108
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,543

00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,079
Please set the way
