1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:01,792
Oh nah

2
00:00:03,584 --> 00:00:04,864
You want me to cry

3
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:15,104
I don't really like onions on my sounds

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,456
I should like goggles

5
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:30,720
Yeah I'm not really good with onions

6
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,840
I have no clue this is the right way

7
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:48,128
Icw on Rachael Ray show

8
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:49,920
I want to daytime television

9
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,832
Deers are just reaching my eye

10
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,840
People put themselves through the device frozen

11
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,728
I had to do it again I would

12
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:15,264
Find a better way of doing

13
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:18,592
Turn off the tap

14
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,200
Can you cut it in half

15
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:27,040
Make a little slit in the middle here

16
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:33,696
Get rid of the skin breakdown

17
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:39,072
And then it's on the way

18
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:02,624
Most people in this way but really want to do is collect from root to stem

19
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,184
Onion in half first thing

20
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:10,560
Leaving the root end and tax I'm going to take a little bit of a stem that's going to loosen up the skin for me

21
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,608
Feel the skin back

22
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,264
So you want to be using the service that you can find because when you use it

23
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,664
Individual cells and that means we're going to release more of those juices that are really going to irritate your eyes

24
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,808
Ring temperature will be more likely to make you cry in the fridge an hour before you take my shifts

25
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:37,184
Turn that sideways parallel with my cutting board and come across and one horizontal

26
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:44,096
Maybe 3 depending on the size of your onions almost all the way through but not white

27
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:47,680
How to turn my onions with the room facing away from me

28
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,984
X12

00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:52,800
4

31
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,616
5 when I come back

32
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,784
Pretty much data itself when I get to the root beer then I can just get rid of that guy

33
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:09,184
Play Simon's group
