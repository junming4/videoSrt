1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,096
Sniff it first

2
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:16,896
The Spice Girls

3
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:24,064
Usually the craziest place that I'll go for it it's like

4
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,720
Oregano

5
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:36,096
It smells so familiar

6
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,656
Arcus Redditch

7
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:46,336
6 percenter based on colour alone at this is Sage

8
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:47,360
Search

9
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:49,408
No that's a

10
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:54,528
Common

11
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:04,256
Gas smells like almonds

12
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:10,656
Everything is kind of smells like

13
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:17,056
Really nice tea party flavour and the best way to open up the flavour in the dish

14
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:21,664
2 this is a bit of oil or butter beginning of the cooking process

15
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,456
I went to Cardiff

16
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,696
This is very tasty

17
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:37,280
Spice

18
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,400
I think it's too much

19
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:49,056
Turmeric

20
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:56,992
Really healthy Spice that's really really good for you and it's a really nice subtle flavour that

21
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:00,320
Permeates the dash on a sort of person

22
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,000
Spicy

23
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,816
This is something red

24
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:13,632
Look at the colon cinnamon

25
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,936
Cayenne pepper

26
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:16,960
That's coming in

27
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:29,248
Can we have hot paprika as we have sweet paprika and smoked paprika is it a really different flavour profile

28
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:35,648
The table comes from a dried sweet pepper and a hot pepper comes from

29
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,560
Ginger powder

30
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:50,752
Powdered onion onion powder

31
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,824
That's

32
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,896
Arania I'm hoping this is

33
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:03,296
Garlic that is garlic

34
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:09,696
I like to put that on my pizza This Is Us

35
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:16,096
Really really strong it's on how to overpower and finishing your dish with dried garlic and other really released

36
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:22,496
Flava Flav

37
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,520
How's things

38
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,080
Dark brown

39
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:26,848
Space

40
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,688
Saffron

41
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,992
Classic steak seasoning

42
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:43,232
This is 100% mixture of spices actually comes from different types of chili

43
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:49,632
Are combined together and we have a range of Hotness that's available and this really great space

44
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:53,216
Base of Flavour in stews and soups and sauces

45
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,568
I don't know what that is

46
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,360
This one is

47
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:08,320
Nervous system

48
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,856
Forget the name

49
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:10,880
I don't know what this is

50
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:14,208
This is curry whatever stains my hair

51
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,512
Is going to be the curry

52
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,071
This one is Kerry

53
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:25,471
You're basic free blend from tons of different spices

54
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:31,871
Next together in everybody's recipe is different so there's no standard procedure with Harry Potter relationship around

55
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:39,551
Just like a lot of other devices in really benefit from long slow cooking in from being added at the beginning of a cooking class

56
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,087
In here

57
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,999
We have chilli powder

58
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,351
Yeah this one stumped me I really can't forget
