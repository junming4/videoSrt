Ok so we need a pillow over here

4
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:17,920
Weather

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,016
Note that

6
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:24,576
This isn't working

7
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:29,184
How far something out really well

8
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:35,072
I cut myself

9
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:40,704
Add a slight incident so cubing the potato

10
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,264
What's the name you just like butter

00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,800
Replace the cube

12
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,968
You want YouTube stuff like the round

13
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:58,368

00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:04,768
Tube in Peel this I'm gonna use this potato peeler to peel away

15

19
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,104
Like surgery

20
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,664

My name is perfect

25
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:42,400
You want to get things as closest to a consistent size which sadly to say this is not

26
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:45,728
When is perfect cube potatoes Romania net worth

27
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,264

28
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:55,968
Sewing appeal in Cuba potato here to fill this potato

30
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:00,576
What we looking to do is make perfect and even

31
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:04,672
Tubes out of the potato

32
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:08,768
In order to get perfect cubes or we can have to do is have some fun

33
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:11,584
Please guys can become mashed potatoes

34
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,192

I'm going to come back across the other direction and we're going to cut these

39
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,576
One more

40
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:37,952
This is a bunch of matching

41
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,888
All done I think they're close enough

42
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,544
It's potatoes
