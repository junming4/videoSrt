1
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:20,736
That's

2
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:37,888
Little bit

3
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:44,544
I'm using because I am not

4
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:51,968
Probably my favourite

5
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:53,504
Slightly

6
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:56,064
For the heart

7
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,720
Put butter on both sides of butter

8
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:12,192
You put it on the bread

9
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:16,288
This is going to be really gross

10
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:18,080
Play Jesus

11
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:21,152
Individually

12
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,528
News

13
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:35,488
It'll be great

14
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,792
You can have some

15
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:44,192
That is 6 and 6 slices of cheese

16
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,640
Go on

17
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,248
And it's summer again

18
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:04,928
Turn up to

19
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:06,720
As hi is it

20
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:14,656
Ok something is definitely burning now

21
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:30,528
The more flipping you do the better because it is

22
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,624
It's a bit crispy brie

23
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,160
I think it's ok

24
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,632
I personally like my

25
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:53,312
I did not cook this evening we are all you see are you still see slices that's the incorrect way to do it

26
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:57,408
I'm going to

27
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:59,456
Underneath

28
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:08,672
Does this is what's going to save you from burning

29
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,352
Do you want to butter both sides

30
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,912
There's no point in trying to make a grilled cheese without

31
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:22,496
So we have a variety of

32
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,592
Archies

33
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,736
Monster

34
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:38,624
The butter in the pan I have to be careful cuz you better can burn

35
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:49,888
The other side

36
00:03:59,104 --> 00:03:59,616
Too much

37
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,152
Siri

38
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,456
Sunny House

39
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:07,040
Very good

40
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,392
The big question is the UK

41
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,047
I like the cut

42
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,095
On the diagonal

43
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:27,263
I'm a stranger

44
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,903
Just logo butter

45
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,999
On the pan

46
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,303
Is it raining at night

47
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:53,119
Smokey rideaway

48
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:59,519
I think is the key for the really classicroses

49
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:04,383
Is that butter has

50
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,199
Ingredients that are not just your fat

51
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:11,039
In the pan

52
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,087
Put the mixture experiment

53
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:18,463
I'm going to go with a slice of Cheddar

54
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,999
And also

55
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:26,399
Because it's really really good soft melting cheese

56
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,471
Let it go

57
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:35,871
To keep an eye on the butter what were looking for is no smoke I'm looking for the foaming and listening for the

58
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:40,479
I'm just doing a bit of a shake to make sure that nothing stuck to the pan

59
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:44,063
So what we gonna do is go ahead

60
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,927
This

61
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:53,535
Remind me to melt before the bread buns

62
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,071
We are ready to go

63
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:04,031
Can we have it that's are you saying she's in there

64
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:07,871
Play some LT with Cheddar and monster in there too
