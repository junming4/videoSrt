1
00:00:01,536 --> 00:00:02,304
Don't

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,328
Your eyes

3
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:07,936
Dyson

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,336
David Turner seeds

5
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:18,688
I'm going to get it on my fingers

6
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:23,808
I think I can do this

7
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:30,208
Not sure what I should do here

8
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:36,608
The Scissor everywhere

9
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:43,008
I'm going to cut I did see a tool that I could use to big

10
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:49,408
Standard issue

11
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:59,392
There's still some season here that's alright

12
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:05,792
Just enough so you don't choke one of my specialties

13
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,328
A more elegant way

14
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:09,120
How to deseed a pepper

15
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:14,240
Who's the first cut off the stem

16
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:19,616
Cut your paper in half

17
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:28,320
So that you can open it right up this fibre and out

18
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,088
Play some mirror

19
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,928
Cutting into strips

20
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,768
And then take those strips and cut down

21
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:44,960
I just need it so see you not going down

22
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,152
How's the baddest

23
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,184
So we're going to deseed a jalapeno and I find the easiest way is the actually

24
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,000
Take one side off of the jalapeno

25
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,536
And take the next side

26
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:12,096
And take the next side

27
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,376
One more time

28
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,544
That was behind the scenes with her heart you always have better

29
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,104
Stop with your cutting if you leave the skin side of the healthy

30
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,408
Facing the board as opposed to facing up

31
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:29,760
The first thing I'm going to do is take these ribs out which is the lighter colour pack

32
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:32,576
Come in with my knife sideways

33
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,624
And just slide right through

34
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,160
What are the ribs removed

35
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:42,048
My First Cut is When We Collide Julianne which is the longest river

36
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:45,120
By Juliana

37
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,400
Come back across

38
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:50,752
Daiso juliennes into cubes

39
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:03,040
I felt like a culinary phone

40
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,064
Music

41
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,600
Gangster music

42
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,416
Fresh produce
