1
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:08,960
Ok

2
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:15,360
I love garlic garlic face before

3
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,952
Skip this

4
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:37,376
Shaking as hard as possible

5
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,008
The skin just comes off

6
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,592
What is this

7
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:51,712
Robert the shamwow guy tomorrow about this

8
00:00:58,624 --> 00:00:59,904
I broke

9
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,256
Garlic press

10
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,840
My mum is this

11
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,968
Luckily I'm very strong

12
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:29,856
Makes me feel like and mediaeval doctors

13
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:35,232
Game of Thrones I'll be half naked Miranda

14
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:41,888
Gaelic is actually cuticles scooping out with your finger making food and getting

15
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:48,288
Teacher at the same time I would also add a bit of salt to this

16
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:54,688
Battlestar breaking it down and giving it that paste like consistency

17
00:01:54,944 --> 00:02:00,576
Skip

18
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:01,600
Whoever thought

19
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,648
What time in handy

20
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:10,304
Ok so I'm going to remove

21
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,072
Close

22
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,608
From the head

23
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:16,448
First thing I do is cut the roots off of the bottom

24
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:18,496
Before you even feeling it

25
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,032
I'm just going to take the side of my knee

26
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:23,360
That will release it from the pier

27
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,920
For making a piston just gonna give you a quick rough chop

28
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:32,320
How many is a little bit of salt and I'm just going to work my way back in 4

29
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:37,952
The song access for abrasive breaks the garlic down

30
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,256
I'm just going to come back and forth

31
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:51,520
I mean

32
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:56,640
Nuffield vampires tonight
