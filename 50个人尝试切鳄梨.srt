00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,304
This is going to be my Waterloo

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:13,824
Because we don't have avocados in Croatian

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,128
Ring Jackie

4
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:25,344
Price

5
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:29,440
Ok so obviously the way you can have with her sister from the top

6
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:34,048
I never seen the inside of avocado ever

7
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:43,008
The cedars getting in the way

8
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:46,336
Rangers Scooby-Doo

9
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:50,688
Take the

10
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:56,832
Take to put out the safest thing to use with a butter knife

11
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,584
This man

12
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:14,496
How big is days 2 nights

My Facebook account

14
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:21,408
Ok no worries

15
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,344
I think you're supposed to do it like this dangerous

16
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,744
This is the part you make sure you eat around the skin

17
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,768
Can we have some tequila

18
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,304
This looks so much better

19
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,680
When professionals do it

20
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,032
And put it in half

21
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,896
Came out so easily

22
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:55,968

Just a bus yesterday

26
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:20,288
Sell with ready avocado slices

27
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:28,736
The first thing I'm going to do here is rotate the avocado around my knife

28
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,064
Knife blade into the pit

29
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:35,136
And twist again and we'll come out cleanly

30
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,672
Then I leave it in the skin

31
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:43,072
Make my slices and then with a spoon in a scoop my slices read out of drive Ocado

32
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,568
Is it supposed to be pretty

33
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:03,296
No ok
