Are you still by The Dude

6
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:32,000
It makes me very uncomfortable

7
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:39,424
Who is the popular

8
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:45,312
Wait the but I'm supposed to go

9
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:55,040
This is harder because of its source

10
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:01,952
I don't like just peel off

11
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:05,024
This is really fine

12
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:11,936
That looks peeled I guess

13
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:18,336
I'm not going to appeal it because we're going out whatever is in the middle

14
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,136
Put on here

15
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:34,976
This is

16
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:40,096
Knife of preference but wouldn't work with this butternut squash

17
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,960
Maybe we should peeled

18
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:47,776
This is

19
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:52,128
Another weapon here

20
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:57,760
Oh that's it that's all

00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:14,656
What the hell Will season

23
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:18,752
There's no seeds

24
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,104
I still don't see said so we're going to keep card

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,896
Jimmy Hoffa

26
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:29,504
Are the seeds down here

27
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,136
So we can use a little night

28
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,696
You can go around the edges

00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:45,888
Drama

30
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:51,776
If you ever need a helping hand

So this is the Edible part of the cord

Canada exercise bar

33
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:01,760
I was doing butternut squash vs

34
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:03,296
That way

35
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,320
We can work

36
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,088
With

37
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,648

Roll a squash

43
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,824
You can do it like this

44
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,848
Show my dad

45
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,896
So it's easier now peel

46
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,176
Because it's

47
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,248
How to appeal

48
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,112
I can do this with a knife

49
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:42,464
But I like the idea of returning the shape and getting as much out of it as I can

50
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,560
Reddit down

51
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:47,328
The mirror

52
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:52,960
If it's two types of food are you don't have to dance like that

53
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:53,984
Trade up

54
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,568
Yeah I go to the gym

55
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:02,688

Set a free call

57
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,600
You were just like you

58
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,880
I use a spoon

59
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:15,488
Scooter or a melon baller

60
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,303
The music rooms

61
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:22,655
Normally when I deal

62
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,703
Get all that Galaxy

63
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:31,615
Because it's really good

64
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,967

STC

67
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:50,303
Ok so what we gonna do now is we're going to peel and deseed a butternut squash

68
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,351
To deal with my wish that I could tell you

69
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:56,703
But I had some crazy trick with going to make it really easy

70
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:01,055
Vegetable you are like this and I just got a sore peeling a squash

71
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:07,455
That's fine you may find that you need to go over two or 3 times to get through the white part in between the skin

72
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,783
Butternut squash soup

73
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,575
Another method here

74
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:18,719
Perfectly acceptable but really just depends on what you find easier so what I'm going to do is I'm going to trim

75
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,999
The top

76
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,303
In the bottom

77
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:25,887
Add the squash service

78
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:28,959
So then I can come in here and I can split my squash

79
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,519
Write on a set it is nothing at all

80
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:38,431
Where is the seeds that the thing that alarm cable have trouble with any inside now away from me

81
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,735
So I'm just going to drop your gloves

82
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:47,135
I meant the inside out now

83
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,159
As well

84
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:54,559
Whatever you have is fine it's just like when you're a kid and you are following

85
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:07,615
Just getting away from anything I just do a little bit of a time and then instead of using a vegetable peeler

86
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:12,479
I use a very nice to do this because if you want to hear you're going to see there's a pretty thick way

87
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:14,783
So when I do it is I said on a flat surface

88
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:18,367
Just come around the squash with my parents

89
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,183
Stream off

90
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,463
Both the play

91
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,023
The skin

92
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,559
All at one time

93
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:29,375
Why have a D&C red and

94
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:31,167
Peel butternut squash

95
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:35,007
Using a paring knife or depending on
