00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:37,632
Jesus Christ

9
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:41,216
I have a feeling this is what surgery sounds like

10
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:43,008
C-section

11
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:49,408
Play like an actor straight line not quite sure what

12
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:50,688
To hear

13
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:55,808
What is this way

14
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,376
Does actually work

15
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:13,472
That's that

16
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:27,040

00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:45,728
Again

21
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,800
I don't like this

22
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,784
Play The Triangle

23
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,344
My brain surgery but still open

24
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,464
Somebody is going to watch me do this and if I do this right or if I do this wrong

25
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:12,864
And say

26
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,424
No

27
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,872

00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:30,272

29
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:34,112
This way it's steady on your board and cut yourself or hurt yourself

30
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,160
I know what I'm doing I'm just in here

31
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,208
Straight down a minute

32
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,488
Turn it around

33
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:44,096
Ok and then we can

34
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,144
From 2:30 quarters

35
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:48,704
Ok

00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,400
We can make it into a triangle

41
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,472
Obsessed with aesthetics
