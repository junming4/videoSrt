Oh boy that is not making nearly as much as I thought it would

7
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:33,184
There has to be a better way than this

8
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,464

Immersion

21
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:31,808
Tricks and it might require a little bit of safety precautions so the first thing to do is coconut water

22
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:36,416
Basically going to hold a screwdriver on the eyes with her on the end

23
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:40,000
Two of them

24
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,888
I just drain the coconut water

39
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,968
And that's how we open the cooker

40
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:42,976
