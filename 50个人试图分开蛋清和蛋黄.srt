1
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:04,096
Is it a trick

2
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:12,800
I think I can do that

3
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:24,576
Does cracking on the side

4
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:33,536
Separate the yolk

5
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,144
How is broken

6
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,960
Listen to garbage

7
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:42,752
Kobe

8
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:53,248
What's that yoke

9
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:58,368
It's weird

10
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:05,792
Wow this is so f******

11
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,840
Is pretty easy

12
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:11,168
Crackerjack play

13
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:16,032
I'm gonna trade back and forth here

14
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:19,872
I putting the baby inside the shell

15
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,808
This is doing it for me

16
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:31,648
Right

17
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:36,768
I actually don't think

18
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:46,496
So the first thing when you're cracking an egg you should be doing it

19
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:52,896
What service is opposed to a sharp surface because that's going to keep you from getting the shell

20
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:55,968
And I always separate between my fingers

21
00:01:56,224 --> 00:02:01,344
This is primarily because the show has sharp edges so my fingers are less likely to Wake Me Up

22
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:16,192
What that is
