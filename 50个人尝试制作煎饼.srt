1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,304
What I'm gonna do is try to do Mickey Mouse ears

2
00:00:03,584 --> 00:00:04,608
Because I like to have fun

3
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:08,960
Pear cake

4
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:09,728
Oh my god

5
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:14,592
Well I never

6
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:15,872
I'll do my best

7
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:22,272
Canola oil on 2%

8
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:24,576
Work it out

9
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:27,904
Everyone that I forgot

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:35,584
That looks better

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,216
Is this like a professional cake making thing this is this

12
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:51,712
We are pouring the batter in the my god

13
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:58,112
You're not round and pretty but hopefully going to taste good

14
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:04,512
Antique is knowing when it's right up there

15
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:07,328
You just want to help it

16
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:13,728
I think it's time

17
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:20,128
It's

18
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,456
Oliver smoke

19
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:27,040
I'm sorry

20
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:29,600
I will be honest and never make my own

21
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,904
Oh my God make some for me

22
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,464
Which is the worst thing to say I am 30 years old

23
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:38,304
Ok I've made pancakes many many times

24
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,936
Amy from this morning actually of canola and butter

25
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:51,616
Do you want to just put in a continuous stream right from the middle so you just

26
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,408
Do you like that you don't move

27
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,688
Your later

28
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:02,368
Sonam is waiting for like a little bubbles to come later

29
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:07,232
There you go with starting to get bubbles

30
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:09,536
Can you check the underside to see

31
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:12,096
Nice colour in the news in a simply

32
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,632
Flip it right over

33
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,848
And then I go like to fight in it

34
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:28,224
That's pretty much it's probably close to down at this point

35
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:34,880
Here we go a delicious on a circular tank

36
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:38,720
You know it's 2018 pancakes can be whatever they want

37
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,632
This is the way you make me

38
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,912
People make

39
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,984
They're on their way but this is my way I make pancakes

40
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,592
First we start with a pan of butter I use whole butter

41
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,616
Four flavour

42
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,152
Just agree Savannah

43
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,712
Swirl around

44
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,600
You don't want so much it is but it's brand new just wanted to be bubbling away ok I'm going to get my bed

45
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,136
Unusual anal

46
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,928
Or large stone

47
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:12,256
Why pick the better up I give it back in so I can get a lot of trips

48
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:15,840
And then I'm going to add to my pan right

49
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:19,424
Slowly put in the pen and then swirl

50
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,984
Lightly so I get that nice round pancake

51
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:25,824
I like to use a riddle if you have a grill at home

52
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,384
Will give you a more space to work in

53
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,200
What I'm looking for is this if you look right here

54
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,248
Does little bubbles have starter pack

55
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,296
What's the bubbles of top star to appear

56
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:38,112
Dennis ready the flip if you flip it before that

57
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:42,720
It's going to splatter everywhere you need to get pancakes to look more like a rush act Esther off

58
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,280
Pink blood testing you are going to have her around

59
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:51,424
I'm using a firm spatula and now you can see that I'm sorry to get some bubbles on the tap I get on to it really quickly

60
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,192
NIA

61
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,216
Ok

62
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,496
Strawberry quick

63
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:01,408
What I'm waiting for now is just so this other side sets we don't need to cook it how much on the other side and weird

64
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:04,224
Do I play pancakes super simple

65
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:07,296
Personally second on top of each other

66
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,320
Right

67
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:12,672
I like the classic way salted butter or unsalted butter

68
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:15,744
Nothing better than their contrast between the saltiness of butter

69
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,559
The fluffy pancakes in the sweetness of maple syrup

70
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:22,143
Real maple syrup as a better flavour than a commercial pancake syrup

71
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,191
Anatomy

72
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:32,895
Koala

73
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:38,527
Enable serial

74
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:46,463
Reminder for 8
