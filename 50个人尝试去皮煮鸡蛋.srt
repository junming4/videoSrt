1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:05,120
You pull it takes a million years and then at the end you have a hard boiled egg so there's really no

2
00:00:05,632 --> 00:00:06,912
Reward for Damien

3
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:16,640
Ok hard boiled egg

4
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:22,272
Looks too hard to do with your SIM using

5
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:28,416
The Pillar scratch the surface or

6
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:35,584
This might have to do with the peeling process I feel like shaking around

7
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:42,496
I'm just going to go right into it and use my

8
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:49,152
Going well

9
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:52,224
I'm taking up quite a bit of a

10
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:53,760
Oh no

11
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:55,040
Looking very pretty

12
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:57,344
Beauty and imperfection

13
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,744
Faster way to do it

14
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,960
Who must be a more efficient way to do this

15
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:17,312
Ok is to Jet Li

16
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,616
Crack the egg

17
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:23,712
I just roll it a little bit

18
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:27,296
I'm not sure what the magic is in the roll

19
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:29,344
Absolutely helps

20
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:30,880
And then I just kill

21
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:34,208
At the bottom is the air pocket and you want to get it from there

22
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,560
Getting around the edges

23
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:43,936
Almost there

24
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:46,752
That's my favourite a big piece comes on

25
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,312
Money shot

26
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,736
Here we go for the perfect hard-boiled egg

27
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:59,040
This is my hard boiled egg peeled

28
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,576
A healer

29
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,048
Islam ways to feel horrible

30
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,888
The key for me for peeling hard-boiled eggs

31
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:17,984
Naturally have a look so when you tap

32
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,264
On account

33
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,288
You'll see

34
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:25,152
On this site it broke but it still exist

35
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:27,968
Beer bubbles on this side and that's what I want to start

36
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,528
Because I want to try and get some water under the

37
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,648
Am I normally do as I tap it all the way around I don't just tap that one

38
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,440
Ice immersion in water

39
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:40,768
And then I start to appeal right to hear that membrane

40
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:43,072
Right I want to pull them away

41
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,888
I'm trying to start to get a little bit of water under

42
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,680
So I just keep on getting in the water

43
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:48,960
I'm pulling up

44
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,776
If the show comes away

45
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,056
Really easy

46
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:55,872
If you have little shards of fragments this also

47
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,480
Hey Google

48
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,928
Very dry
