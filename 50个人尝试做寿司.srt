1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,560
The movie

2
00:00:02,816 --> 00:00:03,584
This is what about

3
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:17,152
I knew it would come to this

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,904
What you need is a nice big piece of seaweed

5
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,304
Outside so this is the awesome rolling matting

6
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,800
Stephen tries

7
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:46,848
I am putting rice

8
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:50,688
Phone David

9
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:54,528
I usually get a price on the outside

10
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:03,488
How much rice am I supposed to use enough

11
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:09,888
I'm putting on the top because it's going to have to roll

12
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:15,008
Next ingredients go into this machine

13
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,592
This Green

14
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:25,248
The Ritz

15
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:39,840
Ok don't worry because when I go to that

16
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,360
Enrol

17
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:02,624
No it's a rolling

18
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:05,696
Over this and that over there

19
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,352
This is too big

20
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,480
Unique way to do it

21
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,272
Meatpacking work

22
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,208
Don't message me this way

23
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,120
The something went wrong here

24
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,104
Oh no

25
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:59,200
0

26
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,624
Yeah you just dig in there

27
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:12,512
Call Laurie

28
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:14,304
Siri

29
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,144
Side of the rough side

30
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,216
Close down

31
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,944
Make sure it's not too hot

32
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,736
Temperature

33
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:33,760
Spread

34
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:36,576
Of rice over

35
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,416
Ingredients

36
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:50,144
Use the roly-poly that's going around it

37
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,936
Pulling the basket

38
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:28,799
Sushi time we're going to make some maki rolls which is basically the sort of standard roll sushi

39
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:33,663
This guy right here the perfect for the task

40
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:40,319
They all look about the same to find out the strings around one way and a baby runs the other and the key here is to make sure

41
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,599
Read directions

42
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:46,463
To the flat side up and the strings running away from you like this ok

43
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:52,863
Play slightly smoother shiny side on the lorry and then we have a slightly Corsa side here

44
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,423
If you want to put a smooth side

45
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,471
Against the match in a season

46
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:01,567
Alright a little bit and we're going to add a pinch of sugar

47
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,455
Dash of rice vinegar

48
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,527
The general rule that the rest of the body

49
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:14,623
You can't reason it is going to stick to

50
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:19,231
A really easy trick to avoid that from happening

51
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:21,791
Tips of your fingers wet while working with the

52
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:27,423
I'm going to the cinema in a rule of thumb is that your race should be to rain stop

53
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,727
If you were to build a house out of race

54
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:32,031
Play bricks you want one brick two

55
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,311
That's about it

56
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,615
The only place I wanna leave a gap is

57
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:38,431
Turn on the top Edge bar furthest away from me

58
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:45,343
I remember less is more so don't go Overboard

59
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,367
Bursting at the seams

60
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,159
Runaway couple steps

61
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:50,207
In here

62
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:53,023
What does around one third of the way up

63
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:56,351
I do is roll this inward and then

64
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,399
It's like a wave breaking in the ocean

65
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,679
I want to pull me

66
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:02,239
Map towards me as well

67
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,775
Ok so when I come down

68
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,151
Towards me

69
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,943
As I make my

70
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,879
Is it going to rain tonight

71
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:29,119
Vegetable maki roll
