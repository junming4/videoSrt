1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:06,400
I've never made her legs

2
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:11,264
I can definitely scrambled

3
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:15,104
I just heard eating eggs a year ago

4
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:33,792
I forgot to do

5
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:34,816
Square one

6
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,144
Cold break

7
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,424
York

8
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:42,240
Maybe I'll do a little salt

9
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:49,152
Westborough ma

10
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:58,624
I like to go by the time you poured on those national sizzle happening

11
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:06,816
My boyfriend's going to see this since I was so embarrassed

12
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,608
Scrambled eggs coming up

13
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,424
Tractor boy

14
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:18,592
The number for the amount of times that I need

15
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:21,664
Jeremy

16
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:27,552
You got a salty taste like my mum's legs

17
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:31,648
This bad boy

18
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,696
Opinion

19
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:35,488
That carries flavour

20
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:42,144
I know that they're ready to hit the pen when they're all Incorporated

21
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,360
I'm looking for them to not look to drive and also not look like

22
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:58,528
I like when it's not too cooked

23
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:10,560
It's a pretty simple task to improve the quality of your scrambled eggs

24
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,096
Where is break the eggs

25
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,632
Always on a flat surface

26
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:17,984
No wish would be fine here 1/4 is fine as well

27
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:24,640
I know these are ready when basically when I stop staring for not seeing you lumps or clumps of either dry or egg

28
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:28,736
What are my eggs before they go into the pier

29
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:35,648
So when were scrambling eggs the really important thing is that you just had some type of fat in the pan

30
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:40,256
Can getting a nice evening coding so my ex girl

31
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:46,656
Allowed sizzle when you add eggs to the pan for scrambled eggs

32
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:49,984
Am I cooking time music

33
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:56,896
I'm actually gonna turn the burner off right before they're ready and just use the residual heat the pan I want these eggs

34
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:03,296
Basically I would have custody which means there's a bit of slightly runny egg

35
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:07,648
16 in between and that we're all looking for a proper scrambled egg
