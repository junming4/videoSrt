1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:05,376
Azan

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,192
Do you want me to do it

3
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:09,984
How to make brown butter

4
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:11,776
Brown butter

5
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:16,896
I have absolutely no idea sounds like brown sugar mixed with butter

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,248
There is a setting on the

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,528
Mrs Brown

8
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,624
I'm assuming clean and use the butter

9
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:40,448
The butter is melted yellow it has not gone brown yet

10
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:44,288
Yeah it doesn't look great so far

11
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,568
Turn it up I think

12
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:51,456
It's getting crown

13
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:59,392
Nightmare

14
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:01,440
But I am a professional

15
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:06,560
He was like this

16
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:08,864
IKEA can get them somewhere

17
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,656
We'll give it a couple more seconds

18
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:13,984
I wonder how round is it supposed to do

19
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,520
Weird stuff

20
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,824
Now starting to smell a little burn

21
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,920
Can a look like

22
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,736
And even though you can make tea from butter

23
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:25,760
Which is kind of cool

24
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:28,064
I have no idea had a brown butter

25
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,856
Ok brown bear

26
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:31,136
Let's see if it works

27
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,184
Soccer in there

28
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:40,608
I'm throwing it around so it cuts the bottom of a pan

29
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:46,496
Swirl caramelise evenly

30
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:49,824
Is going to brown much more quickly than the butter that

31
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:56,224
On top of that when is done it will be Brown another good way to tell when a button is getting Brown is smelly

32
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,528
When I get aromatic as hell

33
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,808
That's when it's

34
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,088
Turning out good

35
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:07,488
Can you smell them Adina of the butter coming through I think I got it

36
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:10,304
This is it

37
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:11,840
Makeup brand that is

38
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:12,864
Is it is good

39
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,704
That's really good

40
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:28,992
Sofa making brown butter I'm just adjusting my heat to medium medium high with the butter

41
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,016
Full blast year

42
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:36,928
What we're looking for is the Sizzling first foaming in the butter and then we're looking for some brown around

43
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:43,328
And what is going to do for us give us a can of sweet nutty flavour to the finished Browns

44
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:49,216
Is a very quick process that is not likely to burn until this is really hard

45
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:55,616
But the milk solids Wilbur and really quickly so what we want to do is keep that moving so we don't have anything just sitting at 1

46
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,176
Then

47
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,712
We are ready to go

48
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,256
Course I do I want to taste this

49
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,072
How do you spell might

50
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,120
Better
