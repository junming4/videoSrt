1
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:03,072
Play goes nothing

2
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:13,312
Oh my gosh French style omelette

3
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:19,456
Ok this butter

4
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:25,856
I'm going to have to break up the eggs how many do you think we need

5
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:28,416
You know what I'm saying is all of them

6
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,048
When will shell in there

7
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,704
So far so now I'm going to beat the eggs

8
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:47,872
I think I've ever even use the worst before

9
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:56,064
So now we have a herbal blend

10
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:57,600
Herbs

11
00:00:58,624 --> 00:00:59,648
Sprinkle

12
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,744
Scattered

13
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,584
This is

14
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:14,240
Ok if you have high cholesterol this is not be omelette for you

15
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:16,032
Something's Happening

16
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:21,152
French omelette is almost done

17
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:24,224
123

18
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,320
It's already looking unattractive

19
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:32,416
Weather for

20
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:36,000
Ok scrambled eggs ok

21
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:42,400
I think this looks perfect

22
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:44,960
Looks ok

23
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:50,848
This is something that would scare most children

24
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:53,408
I don't know what the French say it is

25
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:57,248
So

26
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,528
Stop 1px

27
00:01:58,784 --> 00:01:59,296
2 x

28
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:06,976
You don't need to put the butter in

29
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,256
Why not

30
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:14,144
And then you whip in your amulet

31
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:22,848
I'm just waiting for it to set a little bit

32
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:29,248
I'm really gone for cheese I'm going to skip it on only half of it

33
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:31,808
Inside of a

34
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:39,488
The fun park

35
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:46,912
Flip it over once I'm flipping this site over

36
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:51,776
Flip it

37
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,384
Perfect

38
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,176
Ok

39
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,992
I'll be happy to eat this

40
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,296
Meaning of everybody

41
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:14,048
Today we're going to make a two-egg omelette so what are you looking for here is a few really distinctive

42
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:16,096
Is there a difference in American salon

43
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:21,728
The first looking for is no colour on the ex as opposed to the Browning that you might see on a traditional sort of American style

44
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:26,080
The inside of the army should be slightly custody

45
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:28,128
But not quite ready we're going over easier

46
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,944
The last thing that were looking for is 3

47
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,040
We have all the armour over itself as opposed to just holding it in half

48
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:41,696
In order to get that for me custody text you in the inside we need to really make sure that

49
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:45,536
Eggs are completely even and smooth in terms of the mixture

50
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:53,216
Police station

51
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:55,008
Tbsp butter for an omelette

52
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:58,592
The Exeter go on the piano as soon as the butter is melted in foaming

53
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:03,968
The first thing I'm gonna do is just gently Scramble disabled

54
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,552
Will we need the top of the eye to be a little bit

55
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,344
Before we start to leave it

56
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:18,303
Start to form a sort of skin on the bottom side of the pain relief from the pain and

57
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,607
Just stuck it off

58
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,375
Now

59
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:24,703
You can see the egg in the centre of the Penistone little bit liquid

60
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:31,103
Moving around the Keeper from burning until we see the egg that in the centre of the armour just started gel

61
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:35,199
To be honest

62
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,223
But not

63
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,271
A little bit of goat cheese

64
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,063
Right on the middle of the army

65
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,927
Flight dispatcher London

66
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:47,487
Every day fold in on itself

67
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:55,167
The next thing you're going to do here is for the army in the other way and then roll towards the back

68
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:55,935
The pier

69
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:56,959
Ok

70
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:57,983
Just like this

71
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,543
And they were simply going to

72
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:04,127
Tilt the pan and slide the omelette out on its own

73
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:07,199
The motion is sort of a rotating away from your

74
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:23,327
Salerno's

75
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:26,655
Yeah just give me like 10 minutes then I can finish this and then

76
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,447
Cameras
