Super yummy

20
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:56,832
Stupid expensive

21
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:58,880
A part of a King Crab

22
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:01,952
And this is just one life so you can pick her up

23
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:06,816
The King Crab is a really good slightly sweet me there

24
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:12,192

29
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,576
Believe this is a prawn

30
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,368

00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:43,168
I think it's a lobster

35
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,960
This is a crawfish

36
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:46,496
Croydon

37
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:49,568

00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:39,744
Looks like something out of Star Wars

47
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,912
An elephant trunk

48
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:52,544
Looks like elephant

49
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,944
Is this like a snail or octopus or something some sort of my claim

This muscle that grows out of the claim is used to help the club Burrow into the into

60
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,200
She got a couple of

How do you smell

75
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,303
I think

76
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:23,423
These are called cockles or clams

77
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,983
A video

00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:30,847
Wipeout kids

79
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,663
A range of names that go in a Seat Altea

80
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,711
Confused by them

81
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,015

84
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,951
More than the typewriter

85
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:49,279
Little neck vs cherrystone vs atop

86
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:52,095
Are the same type of claim different sizes

87
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:55,167
I'm not sure what this is

88
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:00,287
I never seen this before my life is a proper job

89
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:03,615
Show which people eat this and find some way to get inside of

90
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,895
How can you put the cinema

Stampy

94
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,575
Another word for occupy

95
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,855
A porcupine

96
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:17,183
Think it might be a sea cucumber

97
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,231
Ceumannan and Eminem

98
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,095

Somehow both

109
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:00,959
Salah

110
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,543

Razor

00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,503
Very tasty

121
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:51,135
You can see why they might be called a razor clam that have the shape of a straight razor a barber with use

122
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:54,975
This is our variety of exotic
