00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:22,240

Dale City nice and chill

39
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:33,248
The classic debate with a martini is shaken or stirred if you shake it is going to be watered down

40
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:38,880
If you start this going to be a little stronger in super

41
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:45,536
With good quality vodka you do better for our support for this ok

42
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,840
Ok so I measure it out

43
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,120
When I get my lights

44
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:56,288
Don't be scared beyond the ice nice and tight

45
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,824
Lois I have my finger

46
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:04,224

50
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:19,071
So what I'm going to do now is going to take my class

51
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:23,423
I'm going to jump out my ice water give it a shake it in the excess water out

52

How long am I from live forever my remove interlock is basically this out
