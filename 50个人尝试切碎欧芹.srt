1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:02,816
This is a mason jar filled with

2
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:07,424
Something green

3
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:11,776
Mum

4
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:22,272
Basil to eat it

5
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:30,720
Is a cilantro parsley

6
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:35,328
What does immense mean

7
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:38,912
I've never met

8
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:39,680
Anyway

9
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:40,704
Nicely

10
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:44,288
It's not that hungry today

11
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:50,688
It would make a nice centerpiece actually

12
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,864
Make me so proud right now

13
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:11,936
The weather

14
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:13,728
Pistol pistol

15
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:20,128
This is the modern that's a pastel that Castle is the more of this

16
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,456
The first

17
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:27,808
Actually made since I graduated College 2 months ago

18
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:33,696
Apart from Les arcs on the television

19
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,280
No no

20
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,656
Cafe until

21
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:43,936
Really

22
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,728
It's working

23
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,152
Play Spotify

24
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:55,200
That should do

25
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,736
Shut up

26
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,624
This is either

27
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:06,208
Cilantro or parsley in it

28
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,744
Poor taste

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,024
This is just

30
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,816
Some parsley

31
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:14,400
Curly parsley vs flat

32
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,192
Italian flag

33
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:18,240
Sleep

34
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:25,408
How to properly mince parsley

35
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,944
Tomorrow in Belfast

36
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,344
Of course I can look sexy boys

37
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:39,744
Out of how to start off with a lot you want to make sure that you really rinse it off

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,096
The best part about this is the leafy part of the ends first

39
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:47,424
Stems don't really taste good

40
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,472
My parsley first

41
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:52,800
So take the leaves off

42
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:53,568
Funfair

43
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,104
If you ever had

44
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,384
Onions

45
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,920
Juicing parsley

46
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,712
It gets rid of bad breath

47
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:02,784
Easiest way to mince parsley is too kind

48
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,576
Folder into itself

49
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:07,136
When s*** together

50
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:09,184
This is what you meant swear

51
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,768
Knitting memes

52
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:17,888
The smallest size

53
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:24,288
How to keep the point of Blade on the boarding

54
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:30,688
Get out

55
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,280
I'm really good in the kitchen

56
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:51,680
Parsley can be put in like a spaghetti sauce

57
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:54,496
Ready for a party party

58
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:58,848
Sprinkle on top of your lasagna

59
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,896
Poo poo poo poo poo

60
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,688
Anatomy

61
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:13,952
Italian flat leaf parsley and disconnects every kind of confusing Arabic

62
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:16,000
Shows similar to cilantro

63
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:20,095
I'm going to do in Midsomer this person right here is what

64
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:26,495
Just hold the Bunch by the stem and take my night at I'm going away for myself and I'm at my dad's swiping motion

65
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,567
From the start

66
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:35,967
Where can I get a few stems of going to sneak their way in there and I'll just go through and double check get everything bundle really

67
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:42,367
With my finger and thumb on the blade and then wrap around the grip

68
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,671
Rocking motion when I make these

69
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:47,487
I'm starting with the tip of the knife on the board

70
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:50,559
As I work I'm just sliding back and forth you'll see

71
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:53,631
Never leaves the surface of the cutting board

72
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,423
The amount of times that you go over the first

73
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:58,239
Completely depends on how final you want it

74
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:02,591
If I want to find a room in this one to do is collect my pile again in a minute

75
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:06,687
How many do the same thing and I come right back over it and just continue to mince

76
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,759
Bringing the species into smaller and smaller

77
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,575
That's all we know

78
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:22,303
Oh my god
