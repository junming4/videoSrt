Sorry

37
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:22,080
Compare two methods with the more traditional why you want to start by grabbing here

38
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,360
And then working away

39
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,640
Around the strip

40
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,432
From the feet on one side

41
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:30,016
Sophie on the other and just feeling that back we can leave the Tail on

42
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:34,112
For something like this room packed in or we can simply just sort of picture of the tail

00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,136

Paring knife

46
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,144
Come through the paradise directly on the backside of the shrimp and asking to review up the van here which you can see

47
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,032
This is the digestive tract of the shrimp and then

48
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,152
Just like that for the second letter of your stream sideways on your work surface

49
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,712
Come in with the blade facing away from you

50
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,016
And you're going to both peel back

51
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,296
And slice

52
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:04,832
At the same time

53
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,880

00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:10,720
