00:00:01,792 --> 00:00:02,560
Stoneacre

2
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:04,608
Can I

3
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:14,336
Peel a tomato

4
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:20,480
I'm wondering if there's a tool here that I could use

5
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:26,368
AutoTrader

6
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:35,584
How to be a better way to do this is looks like

7
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:42,240
No

8
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:43,264
Cured

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,616
Ok I'm gonna start from the butt

10
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:54,016
The guard

11
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:56,832
Let's just call it quits

12
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:59,392
Easier way to the door

13
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:00,928
How do people pee

14
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,208
Tomatoes

15
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,744
Can a tattoo do

16
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:05,536
Straight out of fridge

17
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:08,352
So I may just this very quickly

18
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,376
Glenshane

19
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:15,776
Is really quickly seeing up a fruit or a vegetable and then shocking in a bath of ice water

20
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:19,872
First make an X in the bottom of the tomato

21
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:27,296
What exercise is it a while similar boiling water

22
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:31,392
And another like a little tabs that you pull back

23
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,928
I'm in year 4

24
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,464
A minute

25
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:40,352
What's the inside of metal gates

26
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:46,752
I'm literally just on the phone

27
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:47,776
Ice water

28
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,920
Scanner app

29
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,968
There goes

30
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:58,016
Is like picking glue off your fingers

31
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,232
Portimao

32
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,024
Naked now

33
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,560
On television

34
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,704
Deadpool 2

35
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,984
I'm going to branch

36
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:21,056
First thing I do is take my tomato and take the car

37
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,592
I'm just going to call it

38
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:26,688
To stick the knife in take the core out and it's cool

39
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:31,552
Recording Astoria to the Peel comes off easily after whiplash

40
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:38,208
So they wanted to be in a full rolling boil a dropping in there have a little bit of tomato showing

41
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:42,048
Is all roll around ok it's only going to go in there for about 30 seconds

42
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:45,888
What I'm looking for is that you start to see if the skin will start to peel

43
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:50,496
IKEA is not a cooker to me that you don't want to cook it you just want to loosen the skin

44
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:56,896
So this point I'm going to take it out the water the boiler working tonight then stopped working

45
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:02,016
Opens a nice person leave this on the corner that continued

46
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:06,624
So now they're taking my tomato out of the boiling water and it's early chill

47
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,928
Can you give me

48
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,208
I get a paring knife

49
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,256
I grab a little bit of the skin

50
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,536
And peel back

51
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,352
The skin comes right off

52
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:17,888
Super

53
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,264
And that appeal to me

54
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:34,528
A little basket

55
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:38,624
A snotty nose rather than the Eminem
