1
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,544
Ok not sure what I'm supposed to do with this

2
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,384
No idea

3
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:20,480
Where are first got to take a look at it oh my god

4
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:21,760
Oh dear

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,576
Does anyone buy an idiot

6
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:32,000
I've got the head off

7
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:33,280
Are you this

8
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:44,032
Oh god that's not working I think I need a shorter nice with a girl

9
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:04,512
Oh my god I broke you guys coming bored I'm so sorry

10
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:10,400
I need to get the bones out somehow

11
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:14,240
Just tried to cut into the bottom of a fish and nothing more

12
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:20,640
This fish is resilient to be like starting out

13
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:23,712
I've no idea what I'm doing right now

14
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:29,344
I would really love to know how to do this is supposed to be messing I'm currently

15
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:33,696
Ok I'm hopefully this before but see how we do

16
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,000
First I cut off the head of fish

17
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,352
Ok cut the tail

18
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,960
Official

19
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:49,056
Take your fillet knife

20
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,848
With the bone

21
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:53,152
On one side of the spine

22
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:05,184
I think we feel lazy

23
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,232
There's all kinds of good coming out

24
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:12,608
Body feels weird

25
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:25,152
Around this year there's a couple different ways to do this the first way here we're just going to come right behind it

26
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:27,456
We're going to make one

27
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,736
Straight down

28
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,016
Until we get the spine

29
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:32,320
Make a small car out of the tail

30
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,880
I'm just going to connect the dots from this car

31
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,648
To the sky

32
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:38,464
Using the phone on the top as a guy

33
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:43,072
For when I'm working I'm just using the tip of the blade

34
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:46,912
Just open the Sky app to allow me to see where does the time work

35
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,680
Ok

36
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,728
Now we have two apps

37
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,800
What we can do is work our way down from the top of the fish

38
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:55,616
Where we can do the other afternoon where we started from

39
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:59,200
Tell me another night sideways making sure that we use their guide

40
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:01,504
To determine where and left

41
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,552
And then in this particular matter

42
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,624
What we're going to do is just simply crack straight through the bar

43
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,416
Deserve the fishes river

44
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,952
The general

45
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,232
Fairly delicats

46
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,280
Really easier track right through those guys

47
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:17,120
You're going to end up with all of your ribs right here in the

48
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:21,216
What we need to do is then remove the Rib section of the fillet

49
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:24,288
Take my life and I'm just going to come down at an angle

50
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:27,104
I want my knife resting against the ribs

51
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:32,224
Here's the Rib section here with the belly what's remove that

52
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,272
This is my complete

53
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:42,208
On the second day what we're going to do is the other method for how to remove the fish to make a diagonal coming from the top of the

54
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,280
Any just making sure that you went behind the practice

55
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,584
And again here

56
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:48,864
Make my cat

57
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:53,472
Just like the other method I'm going to connect the dots from where I made my first

58
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,752
To where I make my

59
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:58,080
I'm not going deep this is my guide

60
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,360
For making my

61
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,664
The first mess

62
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,528
Going to do here is go ahead and come down from the top of the fish and we're going to make more sweeping

63
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,064
Gentle cats

64
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,112
And if you can hear that

65
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,392
I want to hear the

66
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,160
Light

67
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,208
Clicking against the rear

68
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:18,303
That's a good indicator that I'm right on the spine and shoulders any flesh

69
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,327
Westbury

70
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,607
In the flying

71
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,167
So as I'm working in a bar

72
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:27,263
But I can do is go ahead and come all the way through working towards the front of the fish

73
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:30,847
What I want to do is just open the Sky app and lifting

74
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,919
Leaving all the bones behind

75
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,735
We have a second floor

76
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,271
Which matches the first one

77
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:41,855
Is Donald the second method moving all the ribs

78
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,879
For attach

79
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:56,447
Little football
