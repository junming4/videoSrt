Zucchini pizza Crazy

00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,960
Cucumber with chicken

4
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:16,640
Pure kiwi ok

5
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:19,200
Anything about the best way the movie

6
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:22,784
I did not know this is a kiwi I thought you told me it was a human

7
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,368
Yeah I have no idea how to peel a kiwi

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,488
This may or may not work like ginger

9
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:33,536
It is not

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,120
Turn the radio off

11
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:46,336
I understand that you don't need it with the hair on it but they're here

12
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:51,968
Is there an Ashley very fast carpet from the sun

13
00:00:57,344 --> 00:01:03,488
I'll just be rated laboriously with an interesting

14
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:07,072
Oh that's Green

15
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:13,728
First start with this pillar

16
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:26,016
Inexpensive cures for thanks but pretty much everything if you just take a sharp knife down the side of it

17
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,296
The skinwalker mouth

18
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:29,344
I'm feeling it like upside down

19
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:35,488
H&M around the edge

20
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:40,352
Suggest take the skin right off

Life hacks

00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,384
Do you need a night

Disney On Ice

25
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:03,904
She's peeled

26
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,232
How many weird

27
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,280
Skinless now

28
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,424
We're going to kill this Kiwi I like

29
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,728
A nice clean kiwi

30
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:18,752
It's just not fair

31
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,288
Can I cut the ends off

32
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,824
I'm just going to play with

33
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:28,992
I find that I get the best results like this just because I have a lot more control this takes a little bit of Technique but

34
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:31,040
You get a nice shaped kiwi from

35
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,088
Ok all the skin is off

36
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,624
Kiwi

37
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:41,024
Another way to cut the ends off first It just gives you a better place to start

38
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,560
Give me sharp Taylor

39
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,096
Radio hand

40
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,144
Mpo last nice and smooth

41
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:51,008
If at the end it's all slipping you can hold it you can always put into a paper towel

42
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,544
So does a cicada have

43
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:59,200
And that's another way to peel a kiwi

44
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,736
First one is a sport

45
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:07,136
Still need my paring knife I've got to cut the ends off and then I'm going to do something to get my spoon and logic

46
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:07,904
The skin

47
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,464
And the kiwi

48
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:14,048
Canape lit around in the skin pretty much as possible

49
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,840
And they go from the other end

50
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,144
Don't worry if the skin breaks are not really going to save it

51
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,680
Anarchy we can dislike

52
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,216
Shoot out the

53
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,752
30p lucky movie

54
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,568
And one of the ways to cut this is the country

55
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:28,384
Always just like a hot dog

56
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:33,760
Can you get a cup with a thin Rim and you can enlarge it in there

57
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:40,672
And just put it onto the rim of the cup where is this is a bit of a waste if you don't have a really

58
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,976
And that was a few ways to peel a kiwi
