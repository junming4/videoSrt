1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:01,024
Like a murder

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,144
Wow

3
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:07,424
Ok

4
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:12,032
On

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,152
Common

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,464
So I have to like my something to

7
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:33,280
Ok so

8
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:44,288
Anyone know if this is that heavy

9
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:55,040
Yeah I don't feel like I should have gone in the charts now

10
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:57,600
Ok

11
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:04,256
Can I have the harder you work on way from yourself going

12
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:08,864
Slightly down

13
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:15,264
Just need to get the string bags

14
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:21,408
It's not my

15
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:33,952
Sharpening a knife I would use this tool here to send interpreting stand for in straightening the blade

16
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:40,352
Techniques my preferred one is to put the honing Steel straight down against the board that allows me to make sure that I

17
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,120
Right angle

18
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:44,704
I'm sure you can find the blade up here

19
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,728
Working camels

20
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:52,128
I find this nothing to be less accurate I find this more conducive for accidents so down or is better in the latest

21
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,920
On the board instead of a house
