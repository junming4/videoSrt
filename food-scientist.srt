1
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:13,056
For 10-years

2
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:16,896
The last time I could probably just a couple weeks ago

3
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:23,296
I make steak once I would make it 1 today if I could but help

4
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:28,416
Whether it be because I lived in friends and I wanted to combine my love

5
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:30,976
For cooking meat and a little bit

6
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,568
It's available in the most perfect

7
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,360

Beautifully mobile

16
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:14,496
You've got a lot of pain

17
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:17,312
Running through the beef

18
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:19,616
This is probably about an inch

19
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:25,504
The perfect perfect

20
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:31,904
Medium-rare or rare

Can be a little tough but you just sort of living things

22
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:37,024
First thing's first

23
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,560
Season

24
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:40,864

So what I'm doing is going to

26
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:49,312
Peppercorns to my shopping list

27
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:53,152
Use a pen

28
00:01:55,456 --> 00:02:01,600
It's called bright season

29
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:08,000
Recreate my Rob I just don't want any

30
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:11,328
Play water reducers

31

Louder

34
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,032
Rosie

35
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:22,848
Last but not least a shower

36
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,640
I'm just going to

37
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,808
What to do next

38
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:32,832
Is pink

39
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,136
With a little olive oil

40
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:40,256
It also will help the rub and here

41
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,704
Going to put some in a bit

42
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,240

00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,032

Plural

50
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:22,496
Say a beautiful piece of meat should never be ruined by 4

51
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:27,104
But sometimes I like to get fancies me and I'm going to cream together

52
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,152
Empire

00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:35,040

Turn halfway

66
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:33,919
Will take about 5 to 6 minutes to cool down and ready to use it

67
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:40,575
Medicard mate and some that I have here so many do basil men

Show me the base of our sauce it's gonna survive with a butter and

70
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:57,983
Pickling liquid with dead before I previously meltdown the butter and coloured down and because

71
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:01,823
Play Down In it's hard while you Incorporated to your eggs

72
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:08,991
How the spark getting you know best

73
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,343
Creamy butter

74
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,647
Sorbus x in that work

75
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:16,927
The last

76
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,999
Ingredients I like to add or the Earth's because

77
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:22,815
Studio be very fresh and

78
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:34,335
So the next thing I'm gonna be doing it

79
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,431
Not everyone has a cast iron skillet

80
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,223
You see before you

81
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,759
The Holy Grail

82
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,039
ACast

83
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:49,695
I've been eating the stuff in the oven with just a slight of neutral high smoke point

84
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:56,095
Hours to be machine machine that keeps the temperature

85
00:05:56,351 --> 00:06:02,495
The same for a long period of time it's 130f

86
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:05,567
And then we'll come back to it

87
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:10,175
So you just want to wait for that actually I just put it on and on

88
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,247
So I'm going to try

89
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:16,063
Play Erasure

90
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:21,951
Out of the water is very important to dry a very well

91
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,279
Perfect steering

92
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,959
I'm going to see you this

93
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,031
4

94
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:41,919
3 to 4 minutes till it gets very very very

95
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:45,247
Who was the hardest thing

96
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,599
I know you're not here

97
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,975
Brown butter

98
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:58,047
Garlic steak marinade that we previously made

99
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,583
Bad from the movie

100
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:16,735
Can I just tell you what perfection is just so perfect

101
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:24,671
I know but that's for the favourite

102
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,719
And then x

103
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:29,279
What flavour and garlic

104
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,327
Now

105
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:43,615
This is the beauty of a cast-iron can it conduct heat so beautifully and it

106
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:50,015
This is probably around as much as I want to click it

107
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:54,111
Where should I think it's been on for about 8 minutes

108
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:59,487
Play machine

109
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:03,583
So what we doing here right now is just seeing them because

110
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,631
This girl is ready

111
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,471
We have a nice day now

112
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:15,615
When I turn this off now we going to a super hard oven 8 minutes

113
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,895
See you in a bit

114
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:22,015
So Disney this ready to go and work in our cooling rack

115
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:28,159
Whereabouts

116
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:40,703
Because if you

117
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,519
So what this is

118
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,823
Can I take my blue cheese

119
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:49,407
Butter which iPad in the refrigerator which is good

120
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,175
Slice

121
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,015
Oyster

122
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,551
And now it's time

123
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,831
Two slices

124
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:01,439
This way

125
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,719
I'd like to come

126
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:06,559
Because it's a little more flavorful

127
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,327
Tender

128
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,095
If you

129
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:12,703
I mean

130
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:22,431
I'm level 1

131
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,039
Play

132
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,575
Right here

133
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:33,951
And then you take your beautiful butter

134
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,487
Can you kind of put

135
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:36,767
Queen

136
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:38,815
Places

137
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:44,191
I'm just going to make it

138
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,727
Put a little parsley

139
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:47,775
Tabitha

140
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,127
Radio

141
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,407
Where is Maesteg

142
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,967
Francine's

143
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,991
Steak

144
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,535
This is good stuff

145
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,663
Very good

146
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,503
All three of us

147
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,783
Different cuts

148
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:38,207
Emily's the flank steak

149
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:44,607
Because it has more connective tissue and less fat it's a hind quarter

150
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,911
Commercial ground

151
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:51,263
The strip steak which is more tender cut of beef

152
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,055
End Marvel

153
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,639
Lever

154
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,943
The strip is also from the Hind quarter

155
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,247
From the muscle called phalanges

156
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,807
It's more tender

157
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,927
Meat Tenderness is inversely related

158
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,743
This story is a lie

159
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,559
Bone in ribeye steak

160
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,863
Which comes from the Rib section of the end

161
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,911
Full of flavour and fat

162
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,703
Arab I was driving

163
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:25,823
Writing is a slow chemical process in which enzymes in microorganisms

164
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,615
Make the meat more tender

165
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,151
Play before by converter

166
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,175
Proteins

167
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,711
Savoury amino app

168
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,247
White Pages

169
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:37,087
We are glucose and fats into aromatic salad

170
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,391
And then releases a lot

171
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:43,231
It happens by hanging dry unwrap large

172
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,767
Download temperature

173
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:47,583
Over and monticello can you also

174
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,119
How to stretch the muscle film

175
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,911
And prevents them from Bond

176
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,775
Parking near on Avon also adds another layer

177
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:56,543
Flavour

178
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:59,103
Moisture Android

179
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:04,735
Because the bones play more slowly than me

180
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:09,087
The overall cooking is slower and more gentle on a protein

181
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:14,719
Emily is a dry Spice rub

182
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:16,511
Which works well on a task

183
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,047
Love me like that

184
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:24,959
You stick spices and salt in her Spice Road disruption we can muscle fibre

185
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,775
Need to retain moisture

186
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,055
She also use

187
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,359
Spicy ingredients

188
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:36,991
But some of the Bee saver you get

189
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,343
Brightspace

190
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,903
This is a special dry

191
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,183
Start this season

192
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,975
