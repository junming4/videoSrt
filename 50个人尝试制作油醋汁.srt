1
00:00:03,584 --> 00:00:05,120
Because I said so

2
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:16,896
I've never made a villain

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,480
I don't know

4
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:26,880
Portions

5
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:29,952
Ok

6
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:39,424
Virgin olive oil

7
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:47,104
Primary fuels like you put the master there

8
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,688
I know it's a setup look like

9
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,720
I'm going to beat up

10
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:09,120
Mustard or whatever sinking to the bottom of the Milky Way

11
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:12,192
Terrible

12
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,336
I have no idea

13
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,616
How to make a vinegar

14
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:24,480
OK Google is a 6 to 1 ratio 6 oil 1 vinegar

15
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:26,528
I prefer 2 to 1

16
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:27,808
Start Waze

17
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,856
One spoon of Mr

18
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:33,184
Take some vinegar

19
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:38,048
Do some extra virgin olive oil

20
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:42,656
Try to mix the vinegar and B12 together

21
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:43,936
Slowly

22
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,008
Dressing doesn't separate

23
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,712
Amazon

24
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:58,016
Everybody taste

25
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,064
If you love you

26
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,600
Go home

27
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:12,864
Ok so we're going to do is make a x a great here to start with a good amount of oil now I'm not really

28
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,936
Specifically measuring this year but when you're aiming for it

29
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,984
About a 3 to 1 ratio

30
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,776
Oil to vinegar

31
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:22,080
Measuring cup

32
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:24,896
And my vinegar is going to record into the bowl

33
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:31,040
Dijon mustard here and mustard seeds are really good

34
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:35,904
Emulsifier that means that they're really good at holding two things that don't want to go together

35
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,672
Together

36
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:43,328
Not the first thing I'm looking forward my babe is it is really well blended in the Formula so sort of going

37
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:49,728
A visual indicator to make oil into the mixture

38
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:53,056
And I want to be with me constantly as I had

39
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:59,456
If you noticed that you're mixing balls moving around a little bit while whisking just take a kitchen towel

40
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,760
Slightly damp that's helpful too

41
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,320
Big lorry

42
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:10,976
I can put my mixing boring here and another word for getting away from me while I'm so whiskey

43
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:17,376
Oil into the boss

44
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:20,192
In the key here is to go slow the entire time

45
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:29,152
That's it

46
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:33,248
Taste

47
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,624
Call boy

48
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:44,768
If you were looking for a dressing that has exclusively the taste of mustard was also feeling intensely

49
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,048
Can I recommend

50
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,840
Where's vinegar I just made
