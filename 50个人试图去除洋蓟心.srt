1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:01,536
That line from

2
00:00:01,792 --> 00:00:04,096
A list of artichoke as in heart

3
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:05,376
New dawn

4
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:13,824
This is my first time holding an artichoke in my entire life

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,640
Heart in the middle

6
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:20,736
Hotel

7
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:21,760
There's nothing left

8
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:26,112
Where is it what is the thing that we eat

9
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:28,160
I just want to peel it off

10
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:31,744
Opening a present inspection something inside but

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,024
What is there's nothing in

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,816
Flower

13
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:37,120
Christy

14
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:41,728
I think I know where the heart is but

15
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,776
Yes

16
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:49,664
I do like since it only has

17
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:52,992
Will using a heart to heart with different animals

18
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:59,136
I'm going to stop this

19
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,416
Is

20
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:06,048
Tell me what I just sliced Turkey down the centre of

21
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:07,584
It's not happening

22
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,632
First thing's first

23
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:12,704
An appeal after few of the leaves camera pattern

24
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:14,496
It's musical

25
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,032
Listen to it

26
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,848
Play clean

27
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:19,872
The stem

28
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:25,760
I'm going to cut off the top

29
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:29,856
White down

30
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,648
Taking out the trash

31
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,696
Nifty

32
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:34,976
Texture

33
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,328
And then

34
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:41,120
Dip in the water

35
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:48,288
The lemon keeps them from getting Brown that my channel

36
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,872
It doesn't look right to me but the heart isn't there

37
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,408
Better way to do this

38
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,808
Ok we're going to find the heart of the art

39
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,464
The first thing I want to do is just removed the really loose leaves on the outside of the artichoke

40
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,512
Is just looking to expose the

41
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:11,328
Lighter yellowish green colour

42
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:17,728
Put on the inside stem of the artichoke is completely edible as well I'm just going to be off the top five

43
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:20,032
Woolley Park that's the outside texture

44
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:23,360
Leave the inside Park which is tender

45
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,152
Towards the

46
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:27,456
Just as leaves off

47
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:29,248
And work my way around

48
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:33,600
The next find the top of the lowermost

49
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:40,000
We're gonna cut it from straight down the green leaves on the outside are the party we want to get rid of

50
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,304
The leaves turn yellow you've made it to the heart

51
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:44,864
Depending on the preparation method for the audit

52
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,448
You may want to remove the choke just take the spoon

53
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:51,264
Dentist

54
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:57,920
That's the joke right there with artichokes

55
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,224
Sensitive meaning that they turn brown quickly

56
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,016
So when you have your other job

57
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:07,136
Exposing clean then you want to quickly get that submerged into water

58
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:13,536
Water with a little bit of lemon juice will really help because the acidity will help stop the oxidation process which

59
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,288
I think I broke her
