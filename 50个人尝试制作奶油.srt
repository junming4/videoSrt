00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:07,168
Shirley

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,640
Whipped cream never made with cream before

4
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:18,432
I've only had whipped cream

5
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:20,992
It's going to be like in Keswick today

6
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,088
I said this before I came in

7
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:27,648
Is it going to be poor in a few

8
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:31,488
Units of cream

9
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:33,536
Oh no

10
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:36,864
Oh this is in a bowl

11
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:43,520
I think you put this in here powdered stuff

12
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:45,312
Baby baking soda

13
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:52,736
I'm sure there's an appropriate amount I don't know what that is

14
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:58,112
I'm not a lady from the Victorian use a helmet

15
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,144
Ok this is happening

16
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,544
Bubbling

17
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,104
Twerking

18
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,064
Ananda Shake

19
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,600
Until we have whipped cream

20
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:32,416
How long will it take

21
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:34,720
Freezer

22
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:37,024
Suggesting

23
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:48,288
I'm going to make with cream and homemade whipped cream with cream I need a bowl

24
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:53,408
Starting with a bore straight from the freezer because the corner of things are

25
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:55,968
Heavy cream

26
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:59,808
You get pasteurized milk it will be easier and faster

27
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,600
For the heavy cream in

28
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:06,464
I made you a little powdered sugar

29
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:12,864
That is going to break up a little easier than my granulated I prefer granulated because

30
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,264
Has cornstarch in it and it tastes so good

31
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:25,664
I would normally do it this way for a person that ever it's basically just a back and forth as a

32
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:32,064
I'm sweating if I do this everyday I would never have to do any sort of our next

33
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:38,464
This is new gold

34
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,864
You are a star on love so there doesn't get all over you

35
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,264
Will it start to look like this we getting close

36
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:57,664
Can I see the ripples from the beaters because

37
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,296
50 weeks on my cycle meringue you might make butter

38
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:04,832
Success

39
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,112
That sound

40
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,904
That's my queen

41
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,928
Whipped cream

42
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:16,096
That's great

43
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,376
Put my face in the snow

44
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,288
Navigate to Lakeside

45
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:28,128
What I'm going to do this at my worst have a nice cold beer

46
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:31,456
It's a nice cold heavy cream

47
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,760
And then we're going to add some sugar and this is key

48
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:36,832
Is two different types of sugar people tend to put in whipped cream

49
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:39,648
What I like to use this plane granulated sugar ok

50
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:45,792
Is confectioners sugar and generally PokÃ©mon starting this and I feel like it makes my work play mode on

51
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:49,120
Something I just enough sugar to get a sweet up the cream

52
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:54,496
And the reason that I earned it now it's because if we had it later my work is going to be great

53
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:57,824
Navigate to our waste and start whipping in this week's

54
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:04,224
And when we wish for you there a risk so you can see when I was staring was making a bubble go right now and wish

55
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,624
It's making a ton of bubbles give yourself a little stability by holding onto the ball

56
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:17,024
Getting sick now we want to whip this to soft Peaks right I don't want to go too far with it

57
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,047
Is it going to forward

58
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:24,447
Eventually alternative sweet butter nice and fluffy

59
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:28,287
Is forms can a really soft velvety piece on the top of my wish

60
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,991
Ok I'm done
